      <t>RFC 5280 specifies several extended key purpose identifiers
      (KeyPurposeIds) for X.509 certificates. This document defines JSON Web
      Signature (JWS) and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) KeyPurposeIds for
      inclusion in the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension of X.509 public key
      certificates. An application processing JWS or JWE may require that the
      EKU extension be present and that a JWS KeyPurposeId or JWE KeyPurposeId
      be indicated in order for the certificate to be acceptable to validate
      the JWS signature or to encrypt key in JWE.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5280"></xref> specifies several extended key purpose
      identifiers (KeyPurposeIds) for X.509 certificates. In addition, the
      IANA repository "SMI Security for PKIX Extended Key Purpose" <xref
      target="RFC7299"></xref> includes a number of KeyPurposeIds. While usage
      of the anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId is bad practice for publicly
      trusted certificates (multi-purpose or single-purpose), there is no
      KeyPurposeId explicitly assigned for JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref
      target="RFC7515"></xref> and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) <xref
      target="RFC7516"></xref>. JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content
      secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
      using JSON-based <xref target="RFC7159"></xref> data structures. The JWS
      cryptographic mechanisms provide integrity protection for an arbitrary
      sequence of octets. JSON Web Encryption (JWE) represents encrypted
      content using JSON- based data structures. The JWE cryptographic
      mechanisms encrypt and provide integrity protection for an arbitrary
      sequence of octets. The cryptographic algorithms and identifiers to be
      used with the JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and
      JSON Web Key (JWK) specifications are defined in <xref
      target="RFC7518"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has specified several
      Network Functions (NFs) and Application Functions (AFs) as part of the
      service-based architecture within the 5G System. The Operators of 5G
      systems make use of an internal PKI to generate X.509 PKI certificates
      for the AFs, NFs, Network Repository Function (NRF), Service
      Communication Proxy (SCP) (optional) and Security Edge Protection Proxy
      (SEPP) (with 5G roaming) in a 5G system. The certificates are used for
      the following purposes:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Client and Server certificates for NF service consumers, NF
          service producers, (NRF) instances, Service Communication Proxy
          (SCP) nodes, and Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) nodes
          (Section 6.1.3c of <xref target="TS33.310"></xref>)</t>

          <t>Certificates for signing Client Credentials Assertion (CCA) token
          using JWS (Section 13.3.8.2 of <xref target="TS33.501"></xref>)</t>

          <t>Certificates for encrypting JSON objects in HTTP messages between
          Security Edge Protection Proxies (SEPPs) using JWE (Section 13.2.4.4
          of <xref target="TS33.501"></xref>) and Section 6.3.2 of <xref
          target="TS33.210"></xref>)</t>

          <t>Certificates for signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens for service
          authorization to grant temporary access to resources provided by NF
          producers using JWS (Section 13.4.1 of <xref
          target="TS33.501"></xref>)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the purpose of the issued certificates is not restricted, i.e.,
      the type of operations for which a public key contained in the
      certificate can be used are not specified, those certificates could be
      used for another purpose than intended, violating the CA policies, and
      increasing the risk of cross-protocol attacks. Failure to ensure proper
      segregation of duties means that a NF who generates the public/private
      keys and applies for a certificate to the operator CA, could obtain a
      certificate which can be misused for tasks that this NF is not entitled
      to perform. For example, a NF service consumer could impersonate NF
      service producers using its certificate. There is no procedure defined
      at the NF to validate the purpose of a certificate. For example, if the
      purpose of the certificate is for the NF service consumer is to use it
      as a client certificate, then the NF with this client certificate and
      corresponding private key must not be allowed to sign the CCA. When a NF
      service producer receives the signed CCA from the NF service consumer,
      the NF would accept the token even if CCA is signed with a certificate
      not issued for this purpose.</t>

      <t>The KeyPurposeId id-kp-serverAuth (Section 4.2.1.12 of <xref
      target="RFC5280"></xref>) can be used to identify that the certificate
      is for a server (e.g., NF service producer) and the KeyPurposeId
      id-kp-clientAuth (Section 4.2.1.12 of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>)
      can be used to identify that the certificate is for a client (e.g., NF
      service consumer). However, there is no KeyPurposeIds to identify if the
      certificate can be used to generate JWS or JWE.</t>

      <t>Vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds that are used in a PKI governed by the
      vendor or a group of vendors pose no interoperability concern.
      Appropriating, or misappropriating as the case may be, KeyPurposeIDs for
      use outside of their originally intended vendor or group of vendors
      controlled environment can introduce problems, the impact of which is
      difficult to determine. Therefore, it is not favorable to use
      vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds for JWS and JWE in deployments that is not
      governed by the vendor.</t>

      <t>This document defines extended key purpose identifiers for JWS and
      JWE.</t>

      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extended Key Purpose for JWS and JWE">
      <t>This specification defines the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-jws and id-kp-jwe.
      As described in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>, "[i]f the [Extended Key
      Usage] extension is present, then the certificate MUST only be used for
      one of the purposes indicated." <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> also
      notes that "[i]f multiple [key] purposes are indicated the application
      need not recognize all purposes indicated, as long as the intended
      purpose is present."</t>

      <t>Applications processing JWS or JWE MAY require that the EKU extension
      be present and that the id-kp-jws or id-kp-jwe be indicated in order for
      the certificate to be acceptable to validate the JWS Signature or to
      encrypt the Content Encryption Key (CEK) in JWE.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Including the Extended KeyPurpose for JWS and JWE in Certificates">
      <t><xref target="RFC5280"></xref> specifies the EKU X.509 certificate
      extension for use on end entity certificates. The extension indicates
      one or more purposes for which the certified public key is valid. The
      EKU extension can be used in conjunction with the key usage extension,
      which indicates the set of basic cryptographic operations for which the
      certified key may be used. The EKU extension syntax is repeated here for
      convenience:</t>

        <artwork><![CDATA[ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId 

KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>, the EKU extension
      may, at the option of the certificate issuer, be either critical or
      non-critical. This specification defines the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-jws and
      id-kp-jwe. Inclusion of KeyPurposeId id-kp-jws in a certificate
      indicates that the public key encoded in the certificate has been
      certified to be used for validating the JWS signature. Inclusion of
      KeyPurposeId id-kp-jwe in a certificate indicates that the public key
      encoded in the certificate has been certified to be used for encrypting
      the CEK in JWE (for example, encrypt the CEK with the recipient's public
      key using the RSAES-OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted
      Key).</t>

    <section anchor="solution"
             title="Implications for a Certification Authority">
      <t>The procedures and practices employed by a certification authority
      MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU extension are inserted
      in each certificate that is issued. Unless certificates are governed by
      a vendor-specific PKI, certificates that indicate usage for JWS or JWE
      MAY include the id-kp-jws or id-kp-jwe KeyPurposeId. The inclusion of
      the id-kp-jws or id-kp-jwe KeyPurposeIds does not preclude the inclusion
      of other KeyPurposeIds.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> are
      applicable to this document. This extended key purpose does not
      introduce new security risks but instead reduces existing security risks
      by providing means to identify if the certificate is generated to
      process JWS signature or used for encrypting the CEK in JWE.</t>

      <t>To reduce the risk of specific cross-protocol attacks, the relying
      party or the relying party software may additionally prohibit use of
      specific combinations of KeyPurposeIds. The procedure of using Excluded
      KeyPurposeId and Permitted KeyPurposeId by an relying party to permit or
      prohibit combinations of KeyPurposeIds is defined in Section 4 of <xref
      target="RFC9336"></xref>. Examples of Excluded KeyPurposeId include the
      presence of the anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId or the complete absence
      of the EKU extension in a certificate. Examples of Permitted
      KeyPurposeId include the presence of JWS or JWE KeyPurposeId.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>In some security protocols, such as TLS 1.2 <xref
      target="RFC5246"></xref>, certificates are exchanged in the clear. In
      other security protocols, such as TLS 1.3 <xref
      target="RFC8446"></xref>, the certificates are encrypted. The inclusion
      of EKU extension can help an observer determine the purpose of the
      certificate. In addition, If the certificate is issued by a public
      certification authority, the inclusion of EKU extension can help an
      attacker to monitor the Certificate Transparency logs <xref
      target="RFC9162"></xref> to identify the purpose of the certificate.</t>
