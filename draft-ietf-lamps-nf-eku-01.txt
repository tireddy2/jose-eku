1.  Introduction

   The Operators of 5G systems make use of an internal PKI to generate
   X.509 PKI certificates for the Network Functions (NFs) in a 5G
   system.  The certificates are used for the following purposes:

   *  Client and Server certificates for NFs in 5GC Service Based
      Architecture (see Section 6.1.3c of [TS33.310])

   *  Client Credentials Assertion (CCA) is JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
      [RFC7519] and is secured with digital signatures based on JSON Web
      Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] (see Section 13.3.8.2 of [TS33.501]).

   *  Certificates for encrypting JSON objects in HTTP messages between
      Security Edge Protection Proxies (SEPPs) using JSON Web Encryption
      (JWE) [RFC7516] (Section 13.2.4.4 of [TS33.501]) and Section 6.3.2
      of [TS33.210])

   *  Certificates for signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens for service
      authorization to grant temporary access to resources provided by
      NF producers using JWS (see Section 13.4.1 of [TS33.501])

Internet-Draft                EKUs for NFs                      May 2023


   [RFC5280] specifies several extended key purpose identifiers (EKU),
   defined via KeyPurposeIds, for X.509 certificates.  In addition, the
   IANA repository "SMI Security for PKIX Extended Key Purpose"
   [RFC7299] includes a number of KeyPurposeIds.  While usage of the
   anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId is bad practice - especially but not
   only for for publicly trusted certificates (multi-purpose or single-
   purpose).

   If the purpose of the issued certificates is not restricted, i.e.,
   the type of operations for which a public key contained in the
   certificate can be used are not specified, those certificates could
   be used for another purpose than intended, violating the CA policies,
   and increasing the risk of cross-protocol attacks.  Failure to ensure
   proper segregation of duties means that a NF who generates the
   public/private keys and applies for a certificate to the operator CA,
   could obtain a certificate which can be misused for tasks that this
   NF is not entitled to perform.  For example, a NF service consumer
   could impersonate NF service producers using its certificate.
   Another example, if the purpose of the certificate is for the NF
   service consumer is to use it as a client certificate, the NF with
   this client certificate and corresponding private key must not be
   allowed to sign the CCA.  When a NF service producer receives the
   signed CCA from the NF service consumer, the NF would accept the
   token even if CCA is signed with a certificate not issued for this
   purpose.

   The KeyPurposeId id-kp-serverAuth (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) can
   be used to identify that the certificate is for a server (e.g., NF
   service producer), and the KeyPurposeId id-kp-clientAuth
   (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) can be used to identify that the
   certificate is for a client (e.g., NF service consumer).  However,
   there is currently no KeyPurposeIds for the other usages of
   certificates in 5G System.  This document defines the Extended Key
   Usage (EKU) extension of X.509 public key certificates for signing
   the JWT Claims set using JWS, encrypting JSON objects in HTTP
   messages using JWE, and signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens using
   JWS.

   Vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds that are used in a PKI governed by the
   vendor or a group of vendors pose no interoperability concern.
   Appropriating, or misappropriating as the case may be, KeyPurposeIds
   for use outside of their originally intended vendor or group of
   vendors controlled environment can introduce problems, the impact of
   which is difficult to determine.  Therefore, it is not favorable to
   use vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extended Key Purpose for Network Functions

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-jwt, id-kp-
   httpContentEncrypt, id-kp-oauthAccessTokenSigning for respectively
   signing the JWT Claims set of CCA using JWS, encrypting JSON objects
   in HTTP messages between Security Edge Protection Proxies (SEPPs)
   using JWE and signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens for service
   authorization to grant temporary access to resources provided by NF
   producers using JWS.  As described in [RFC5280], "[i]f the [Extended
   Key Usage] extension is present, then the certificate MUST only be
   used for one of the purposes indicated."  [RFC5280] also notes that
   "[i]f multiple [key] purposes are indicated the application need not
   recognize all purposes indicated, as long as the intended purpose is
   present."

   Applications verifying the signature of a Client Credentials
   Assertion (CCA) represented as JWT, decrypting JSON objects in HTTP
   messages between Security Edge Protection Proxies (SEPPs) using JWE
   or verifying the signature of an OAuth 2.0 access tokens for service
   authorization to grant temporary access to resources provided by NF
   producers using JWS MAY require corresponding KeyPurposeIds be
   specified by the EKU extention.  In addition, such application MUST
   require the keyUsage extension be set to digitalSignature or
   nonRepudiation (also designated as contentCommitment) for the
   signature calculation and/or to keyEncipherment for encryption of the
   secret key.

4.  Including the Extended KeyPurpose in Certificates

   [RFC5280] specifies the EKU X.509 certificate extension for use on
   end entity certificates.  The extension indicates one or more
   purposes for which the certified public key is valid.  The EKU
   extension can be used in conjunction with the key usage extension,
   which indicates the set of basic cryptographic operations for which
   the certified key may be used.  The EKU extension syntax is repeated
   here for convenience:

   ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

   KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

Internet-Draft                EKUs for NFs                      May 2023


   As described in [RFC5280], the EKU extension may, at the option of
   the certificate issuer, be either critical or non-critical.
   Inclusion of KeyPurposeId id-kp-jwt, id-kp-httpContentEncrypt and id-
   kp-oauthAccessTokenSigning in a certificate indicates that the public
   key encoded in the certificate has been certified to be used for
   validating the the JWS Signature in JWT, encrypting JSON objects in
   HTTP messages (for example, encrypt the CEK with the recipient's
   public key using the RSAES-OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE
   Encrypted Key) and signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens.  The
   distinction between JWS and JWE is performed via the KU that is set
   to digitalSignature or nonRepudiation for JWS and dataEncipherment
   for JWE.

        id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= {
          iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
          security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) kp(3) }

   id-kp-jwt OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD1 }
   id-kp-httpContentEncrypt OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD2 }
   id-kp-oauthAccessTokenSigning OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD3 }

5.  Implications for a Certification Authority

   The procedures and practices employed by a certification authority
   MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU extension as well as
   the KU extension are inserted in each certificate that is issued.
   The inclusion of the id-kp-jwt, id-kp-httpContentEncrypt and id-kp-
   oauthAccessTokenSigning KeyPurposeIds does not preclude the inclusion
   of other KeyPurposeIds.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5280] are applicable to this
   document.  This extended key purpose does not introduce new security
   risks but instead reduces existing security risks by providing means
   to identify if the certificate is generated to sign the JWT Claims
   Set, signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens using JWS or to encrypt the
   CEK in JWE for encrypting JSON objects in HTTP messages.

   To reduce the risk of specific cross-protocol attacks, the relying
   party or the relying party software may additionally prohibit use of
   specific combinations of KeyPurposeIds.  The procedure of using
   Excluded KeyPurposeId and Permitted KeyPurposeId by an relying party
   to permit or prohibit combinations of KeyPurposeIds is defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC9336].  Examples of Excluded KeyPurposeId include
   the presence of the anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId or the complete
   absence of the EKU extension in a certificate.  Examples of Permitted
   KeyPurposeId include the presence of id-kp-jwt, id-kp-
   httpContentEncrypt or id-kp-oauthAccessTokenSigning KeyPurposeId.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   In some security protocols, such as TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], certificates
   are exchanged in the clear.  In other security protocols, such as TLS
   1.3 [RFC8446], the certificates are encrypted.  The inclusion of EKU
   extension can help an observer determine the purpose of the
   certificate.  In addition, If the certificate is issued by a public
   certification authority, the inclusion of EKU extension can help an
   attacker to monitor the Certificate Transparency logs [RFC9162] to
   identify the purpose of the certificate.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following OIDs in the "SMI Security
   for PKIX Extended Key Purpose" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3).  This OID
   is defined in Section 4.
