X.509 Certificate Extended Key Usage (EKU) for Javascript Object Signing
                             and Encryption
                     draft-reddy-lamps-jose-eku-00

Abstract

   RFC 5280 specifies several extended key purpose identifiers
   (KeyPurposeIds) for X.509 certificates.  This document defines JSON
   Web Signature (JWS) and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) KeyPurposeIds for
   inclusion in the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension of X.509 public
   key certificates.  An application processing JWS or JWE may require
   that the EKU extension be present and that a JWS KeyPurposeId or JWE
   KeyPurposeId be indicated in order for the certificate to be
   acceptable to validate the JWS signature or to encrypt key in JWE.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] specifies several extended key purpose identifiers
   (KeyPurposeIds) for X.509 certificates.  In addition, the IANA
   repository "SMI Security for PKIX Extended Key Purpose" [RFC7299]
   includes a number of KeyPurposeIds.  While usage of the
   anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId is bad practice for publicly trusted
   certificates (multi-purpose or single-purpose), there are no extended 
   key usages (KeyPurposeIds) explicitly assigned for JSON Web Signature (JWS)
   [RFC7515] and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516]. JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital signatures or
   Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JSON-based [RFC7159] data
   structures.  The JWS cryptographic mechanisms provide integrity
   protection for an arbitrary sequence of octets. JSON Web Encryption
   (JWE) represents encrypted content using JSON-based data structures.
   The JWE cryptographic mechanisms encrypt and provide integrity
   protection for an arbitrary sequence of octets. The cryptographic
   algorithms and identifiers to be used with the JSON Web Signature
   (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE) are defined in [RFC7518].

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has specified several
   Network Functions (NFs) as part of the service-based architecture within 
   the 5G System in [TS23.501]. The Operators of 5G systems make use of an internal PKI 
   to generate X.509 certificates for the NFs in a 5G system.

   The certificates are used for the following purposes:

   *  TLS EE Client and Server certificates for 5GC Service Based Architecture (SBA) NFs
      (Section 6.1.3c of [TS33.310])

   *  Certificates for signing Client Credentials Assertion (CCA) tokens
      using JWS (Section 13.3.8.2 of [TS33.501])

   *  Certificates for encrypting JSON objects in HTTP messages between
      Security Edge Protection Proxies (SEPPs) using JWE
      (Section 13.2.4.4 of [TS33.501]) and Section 6.3.2 of [TS33.210])

   *  Certificates for signing the OAuth 2.0 access tokens for service
      authorization to grant temporary access to resources provided by
      NF producers using JWS (Section 13.4.1 of [TS33.501])

   If the purpose of the issued certificates is not restricted, i.e.,
   the type of operations for which a public key contained in the
   certificate can be used are not specified, those certificates could
   be used for another purpose than intended, violating the CA policies,
   and increasing the risk of cross-protocol attacks.  Failure to ensure
   proper segregation of duties means that a NF who generates the
   public/private keys and applies for a certificate to the operator CA,
   could obtain a certificate which can be misused for tasks that this
   NF is not entitled to perform.  For example, a NF service consumer
   could impersonate NF service producers using its certificate. 
   Another example, if the purpose of the certificate for
   the NF service consumer is to use it as a TLS EE client certificate, then 
   the NF with this TLS EE client certificate and corresponding private key
   must not be allowed to sign the CCA. In case that a NF service producer
   received the signed CCA from the NF service consumer, the NF would
   accept the token, even if CCA is signed with a certificate not issued
   for this purpose.

   The KeyPurposeId id-kp-serverAuth (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) can
   be used to identify that the certificate is for a TLS server (e.g., NF
   service producer), and the KeyPurposeId id-kp-clientAuth
   (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) can be used to identify that the
   certificate is for a TLS client (e.g., NF service consumer). However,
   there are no KeyPurposeIds to identify whether the certificate can be used
   to generate JWS or JWE.

   Vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds that are used in a PKI governed by the
   vendor or a group of vendors pose no interoperability concern.
   Appropriating, or misappropriating as the case may be, KeyPurposeIds
   for use outside of their originally intended vendor or group of
   vendors controlled environment can introduce problems, the impact of
   which is difficult to determine. Therefore, it is not favorable to
   use vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds for JWS and JWE in deployments that
   are not governed by the vendor.

   This document defines extended key purpose identifiers for JWS and
   JWE.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extended Key Purpose for JWS and JWE

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-jws and id-kp-jwe.
   As described in [RFC5280], "[i]f the [Extended Key Usage] extension
   is present, then the certificate MUST only be used for one of the
   purposes indicated."  [RFC5280] also notes that "[i]f multiple [key]
   purposes are indicated the application need not recognize all
   purposes indicated, as long as the intended purpose is present."

   Applications processing JWS or JWE MAY require that the EKU extension
   be present and that the id-kp-jws or id-kp-jwe be indicated in order
   for the certificate to be acceptable to validate the JWS Signature or
   to encrypt the JSON objects or other content in JWE.

4.  Including the Extended KeyPurpose for JWS and JWE in Certificates

   [RFC5280] specifies the EKU X.509 certificate extension for use on
   end entity certificates. The extension indicates one or more
   purposes for which the certified public key is valid. The EKU
   extension can be used in conjunction with the key usage extension,
   which indicates the set of basic cryptographic operations for which
   the certified key may be used. The EKU extension syntax is repeated
   here for convenience:

   ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

   KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

Internet-Draft                EKU for JOSE                  January 2023


   As described in [RFC5280], the EKU extension may, at the option of
   the certificate issuer, be either critical or non-critical.  This
   specification defines the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-jws and id-kp-jwe.
   Inclusion of KeyPurposeId id-kp-jws in a certificate indicates that
   the public key encoded in the certificate has been certified to be
   used for validating the JWS signature.  Inclusion of KeyPurposeId id-
   kp-jwe in a certificate indicates that the public key encoded in the
   certificate has been certified to be used for encrypting the JSON object in
   JWE (for example, encrypt the CEK with the recipient's public key
   using the RSAES-OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key).

        id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= {
          iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
          security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) kp(3) }

   id-kp-jws OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD1 }
   id-kp-jwe OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD2 }

5.  Implications for a Certification Authority

   The procedures and practices employed by a certification authority
   MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU extension are
   inserted in each certificate that is issued.  Unless certificates are
   governed by a vendor-specific PKI, certificates that indicate usage
   for JWS or JWE MAY include the id-kp-jws or id-kp-jwe KeyPurposeId.
   The inclusion of the id-kp-jws or id-kp-jwe KeyPurposeIds does not
   preclude the inclusion of other KeyPurposeIds.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5280] are applicable to this
   document.  This extended key purpose does not introduce new security
   risks but instead reduces existing security risks by providing means
   to identify if the certificate is generated to process JWS signature
   or used for encrypting the CEK in JWE.

   To reduce the risk of specific cross-protocol attacks, the relying
   party or the relying party software may additionally prohibit use of
   specific combinations of KeyPurposeIds.  The procedure of using
   Excluded KeyPurposeId and Permitted KeyPurposeId by an relying party
   to permit or prohibit combinations of KeyPurposeIds is defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC9336].  Examples of Excluded KeyPurposeId include
   the presence of the anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId or the complete
   absence of the EKU extension in a certificate.  Examples of Permitted
   KeyPurposeId include the presence of JWS or JWE KeyPurposeId.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   In some security protocols, such as TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], certificates
   are exchanged in the clear.  In other security protocols, such as TLS
   1.3 [RFC8446], the certificates are encrypted.  The inclusion of EKU
   extension can help an observer determine the purpose of the
   certificate.  In addition, If the certificate is issued by a public
   certification authority, the inclusion of EKU extension can help an
   attacker to monitor the Certificate Transparency logs [RFC9162] to
   identify the purpose of the certificate.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following OIDs in the "SMI Security
   for PKIX Extended Key Purpose" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3).  This OID
   is defined in Section 4.
